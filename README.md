The Interactive Quiz Application is a responsive, browser-based web app built using fundamental front-end technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — within Visual Studio Code.
This project is designed to help users test their knowledge of core web development technologies. All questions included in the quiz are related specifically to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application dynamically loads questions, provides instant feedback upon selection, and keeps track of the user’s score in real-time. The clean and modern user interface ensures a smooth and engaging user experience across different devices.
